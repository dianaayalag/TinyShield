# TinyShield
Prevent taking screenshots on iOS

## Usage

Just create a view with

`let tinyShieldView = TinyShieldView()
self.view.addSubview(tinyShieldView)`
    
Since it inherits from UIView, you can easily add constraints or customize the view as you like.

When someone takes screenshots, everything inside of the TinyShieldView will be hidden.
